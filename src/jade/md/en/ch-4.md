# 4. Collaborative Relationships in Civic Tech

:::danger
## Key Findings

### People are the key factor in the current development of civic tech

In the face of inadequate systems, civic tech collaboration requires effort from people in a variety of roles: leaders must contribute political support, mediators must engage in communication and coordination, and the collaborating parties must share goals and values and be willing to learn each other’s language and culture.

### Civic tech emphasizes equality, mutual benefit, and an open approach to power and relationships

The goal of civic tech is to establish equal and mutually beneficial collaborative relationships, not to provide IT services for free. As the collaborating parties identify problems and streamline processes together, civic tech provides not only open tools and mechanisms, but also an open approach to power and relationships in the interaction process.

### Governments must re-think their approach to governance and shift first toward "small government" and finally toward “open government”

Civic tech goes beyond the traditional top-down model of bureaucratic governance, emphasizing a network of horizontal connections that transforms the government from a ruler to an open collaborator. This transformation enables a shift from big government toward small government, and finally toward open government.

### Future challenges: How can both old and new mechanisms and systems be integrated?

Thus far, civic tech collaboration in Taiwan has been limited to single ad-hoc cases. With no institutionalized model for co-operation, the scale of influence remains limited. There are also no clear rules on where the responsibility for operational maintenance lies, and who is ultimately accountable. How systems and processes created by civic tech can be integrated into existing mechanisms is currently a major challenge.

### Future challenges: How can a mature civic tech ecosystem be established?

Taiwan urgently needs a civic tech ecosystem that incorporates governments, communities, and corporations, instead of relying on the efforts and networks of a few, in order to expand the scale and influence of civic tech.

## 4-1. Civic tech: A New Possibility for Public-Private Collaboration

This chapter will explore civic tech collaboration as a new approach through a variety of case studies. We define civic tech as the use of digital technology on the basis of open data and citizen participation to transform government services, optimize administrative processes, and enable participation in government operations. Civic tech represents a break from the idea of “social contract”, in which the people vest power in the government to rule and manage society unilaterally; it is a rethinking of the interaction of power between the government and the people, and a practical exploration of new possibilities in public-private collaboration.

Public-private collaboration is not something new to our time. The idea of public-private partnerships (PPP) emerged in the 1990s, though even today academics are still divided over its precise definition. Broadly, the term PPP refers to cooperative relationships between organizations in the public and private sector, whether codified in formal contracts or spontaneously arising from shared values. Chen and Zhang (2010) pointed out that PPP participants create a high level of trust through frequent interaction, and share resources, goals, and values, thereby establishing "collaborative networks." In this chapter, our conception of public-private collaboration emphasizes civic tech collaboration created through collaborative networks between government agencies and communities or individuals. Unlike traditional PPPs, which usually refer to large-scale cooperation between governments and corporations (e.g. through the Build-Operate-Transfer model), civic tech introduces new models and cultural ideas and practices through small-scale and diverse interactions with governments.

This chapter provides four case studies using in-depth interviews as the main source. We explore their respective backgrounds, problems to be solved, collaboration models, challenges faced, and possible future effects. We focus on three important facets of each case in particular (see Chen and Zhang, 2010): (1) Whether the parties are equals in the power relationship, and whether they share resources, information, goals, and values; (2) Whether the collaboration process maintains an appropriate balance between collective goals and individual interests; and (3) How the participants use their social capital to create a network and build relationships of mutual trust.


We have seen impressive examples of civic tech in action over the past three years. Civic tech has provided aid during emergencies, improved administrative processes across organizations, opened up new channels for deliberation on important issues for the digital age, and promoting participation in environmental causes through citizen science initiatives. In Taiwan, however, civic tech collaboration remains experimental. Civic tech has mitigated the administrative inefficiencies brought on by inflexible IT procurement rules, while avoiding the problems of collusion and corruption that traditional PPP models risk.

And yet, large-scale influence remains elusive for civic tech in Taiwan due to a lack of mature business models and systemic integration into existing government operations. Our intent in discussing civic tech in this final chapter is to invite the reader to join us in thinking to the future, in addition to looking back on the developments of the past three years. What is the potential of civic tech in comparison to other possible approaches for a future governance model? What are the challenges that must be faced before civic tech can become truly influential?

### An Explosion Results in Taipei’s First Civic Tech Collaboration

A dust explosion at the Formosa Fun Coast Amusement Park during a "color party" event on June 27, 2015 shocked Taiwanese society, and sparked the first example of public-private collaboration between the government of Taipei City and its tech communities. Taipei City Hall was overwhelmed with phone calls as staff attention was focused on disaster relief work, and an online platform for searching for victim information was proposed. However, the city’s Department of Information Technology had no open-ended contract in place to acquire temporary workers or equipment in emergencies, and regular procurement processes could not work quickly enough for this need. The City Government therefore requested aid from the communities.

With this request for aid, City Hall and the community began to work together. Tech community member TonyQ first converted the list of casualties into a structured dataset and published it online. Two hours after the data was made public, volunteers across the internet had programmed ten different systems for searching the data that Taipei City Hall linked to its official website, allowing anxious friends and family to look up the status of injured loved ones.

### Open Source Programs in Disaster Prevention and Relief

After the Formosa Fun Coast explosion, Saul Peng twice [^first] invited city government agencies and civic tech communities to meetings discussing how to establish relief mechanisms to improve crisis management during a disaster. These two meetings were an opportunity for City Hall staff to forge connections with civic tech communities. Tseng I-hsin and Yu Ting-ting of the Department of Social Welfare even submitted a proposal at a g0v hackathon in December 2015, and began two collaborative projects with the g0v community to help improve disaster relief—donation maps and a digital system to identify victims.

The donation map project created a dynamic management platform for donated goods after a disaster. The idea for the project was inspired by an in-kind donation collection system designed by Ju Yu-ren and Shih Chia-lin for an effort to recall legislators from the then-ruling KMT party; the project was eventually developed into a submission for a disaster relief application contest. The victim identification system was proposed and developed by Liu Yutin in a hackathon. The system is in essence a digital registration system that allows shelters to keep track of victims’ movements in a chaotic scene after a disaster, and provides information for family members to find their loved ones.

Ju Yu-ren and Liu Yu-tin, the developers of these two systems, are both members of the g0v community. They are passionate about applying open source technology to public services, not only participating in the development of information search systems for Formosa Fun Coast victims, but also in the discussions convened by Saul Peng. They then volunteered to contribute their IT expertise to Taipei City, helping the city government improve its administrative services.

Throughout the process, from the hackathon to the meetings in City Hall, no contract was signed between the Department of Social Welfare and Ju and Liu, nor was any money exchanged. The Department of Social Welfare provided information and resources, while the community provided the technology. The two parties complemented and trusted each other, and collaborated on accomplishing their common goal. For Ju and Liu, making the system open source was an essential requirement of the collaboration. Only when the system is open source can it be modified and reused by others, making it a long-lasting public good. Open source was an unfamiliar idea for the Department of Social Welfare, but the agency saw that the open source system could help digitalize administrative work, and that such open-source sharing of public services could reduce the workload of government agencies and save on resources that would be expended for developing similar systems from scratch. The agency was therefore happy to accept the open source requirement.

### Bridge Builders Are the Key to Civic Tech Collaboration

Taipei City is uniquely well-suited for developing civil tech collaborations compared to other counties and cities in Taiwan. The political will of its leaders and support of mid-level management ensured that Taipei City’s experience in promoting open data and civic participation has been relatively smooth. Taipei is also home to an important cluster of technology communities. Crucially, Taipei City Hall also had staffers who were willing to serve as contact points for community cooperation. Saul Peng and Tseng I-hsin served as important bridge builders within City Hall, skilled at both seeking external assistance as well as internal communication and coordination. Faced with the very different cultures and languages of the government and civic society, these bridge builders are both a buffer between the two sides and an engine for action.

Civic tech collaboration is not just about outsourcing technology. The political will of leaders and the social capital of these bridge builders are essential for integrating civic tech into government operations. However, an over-reliance on a few bridge builders, and the lack of institutionalized procedures and mature collaborative networks, has become a predicament for civic technology collaboration in Taiwan. Once a bridge builder departs from their position, the relationships and trust that have been built up may vanish in the blink of an eye.

## 4-3. Document Delivery Management System: Using Digital Tools to Improve Administrative Processes

> * Case: Official document delivery management system
> * Problem statement: Administrative processes are unnecessarily convoluted
> * Government collaborator(s): Taipei City Department of Social Welfare
> * Civil society collaborator(s): TonyQ

### Reforming Administrative Processes with the Power of Digital Technology

In the previous case, applying civic tech to disaster relief opened up new possibilities beyond traditional IT procurement for governments. However, donation maps and disaster victim identification systems are not IT systems that see everyday use. Reforming overall administrative processes using digital tools and data governance is the next challenge for civic tech.

The previous case mentioned meetings convened by Saul Peng after the Formosa Fun Coast explosion in 2015 that formed connections between Department of Social Welfare (DOSW) staffers and tech communities. Soon after the meetings, Tseng I-hsin of the DOSW shared her troubles with tracking the delivery of official documents on her personal Facebook page. TonyQ, a community member, volunteered to help the DOSW solve this problem with digital technology. 

The DOSW is the Taipei City government’s largest agency, and is responsible for administering the city’s various social welfare systems. After an application for a subsidy is received, the DOSW will mail a physical copy of an official document notifying the applicant of whether the application was granted. The delivery of the document is tracked using the post office’s registered mail system. However, the process is completely non-digital. Staffers must keep track of thousands of physical mail receipts, and identify the receipt involved whenever an appeal is filed regarding a decision. Though this problem seems extremely minor, it nonetheless creates a heavy workload for the department.

TonyQ proposed a simple solution: tracking the delivered documents using a QR code. However, simple solutions often require complicated communication when the government is involved. TonyQ and the collaborating staffers had to visit several offices in the DOSW as well as the Department of Information Technology and Chunghwa Post (Taiwan’s official post office) in order to gain an in-depth understanding of how a document is produced, delivered, and the receipt obtained. After understanding the entire process, he had to tackle the problems of incorporating the new tool into existing systems. For TonyQ, civic tech collaboration is "especially for those solutions that are too small to receive the resources to open a formal bid, but have the potential to solve critical problems." This case created an example for digitalizing administrative processes, allowing the collaboration model and culture to take root in the government. Although the specifics of the case cannot be copied directly, the idea and spirit of collaboration is something that can spread [^second]. 

### Long-term Partnership: Start by Identifying the Right Problems

Government is an enormous and complex machine. Over the past few decades, the civil service has exchanged information and communicated through meetings, official documents, and files, creating a unique information flow in every department. It is therefore impossible to digitalize the entire government using a single system, and civic tech has no such ambitions. Its goal is to solve small but concrete problems and introduce digitalization to administrative processes.

However, identifying these small but concrete problems is precisely the challenge. 

Government agencies must first identify their needs through reviewing their processes. However, civil service training does not include process management skills. In addition, government staffers are usually too overworked to even find the time to articulate problems and clarify processes. Agencies with no IT background are usually unable to clearly describe their needs, while contractors are unable to understand the complicated inner workings of government. The enormous rift in language and culture between the two parties, the misunderstandings that arise as communication passes through level after level of the bureaucracy, coupled with complex webs of interest between bid reviewers and contractors, all contribute to the frequently absurd outcomes of IT tenders. Such tenders often result in systems that are difficult for staffers to use, or e-government services that draw waves of complaints.

Civic tech provides more than a single system or website; it allows external collaborators to interact directly with the agency, clearly identifying problems through long-term partnership. The system that TonyQ created is not difficult, but few are willing to spend as much time as he did as an external collaborator in low-level government offices, listening and communicating. Such external players also require the trust of the civil service system and the approval of mid- and high-level leaders. Under these conditions, TonyQ was able to continue working with the DOWS after developing the mail tracking system and began more collaboration projects. 

### Difficulties Faced by Civic Tech in Government

Civic tech currently faces many difficulties regarding its use in government. First, volunteers who participate in collaboration cannot receive adequate compensation for their time and energy. Most collaborators receive only a small stipend when they attend meetings in person at government agencies. In the long run, how to give collaborators the respect and remuneration they deserve, so that collaborative relationships can be sustained and more collaborators encouraged to join, is a question that will require more thought.

Second, civic tech development almost always uses agile development to create a minimum feasible product that immediately goes online to solve a specific task-based problem. It can become impossible to maintain operations of a system once a collaborative relationship ends. Government often requires more stable and long-term systems, giving contractors with stable funding and concrete agreements an advantage over civil tech. Whether civic tech can integrate systems created through agile development into existing government platforms through feedback and optimization, will become another key to bringing civic tech into government.

## 4-4. AirBox: Building a Civic Tech Ecosystem

> * Case: AirBox
> * Problem statement: Environmental issues
> * Government collaborator(s): 8 county and city governments [^third]
> * Civil society collaborator(s): LASS community, Academia Sinica Institute of Information Science, and IT companies

### A Civic Tech Ecosystem of Governments, Companies, and Communities

In the previous case, we identified two major difficulties currently faced by civic tech: First, that unpaid collaborators may be treated as free contractors; and second, that maintaining long-term operation of civic tech is often filled with uncertainty. Taiwan urgently needs governments, companies, and communities to form an ecosystem that can act as a foundation for developing civic tech. The case of AirBox may point to one way forward.

AirBox is a real-time sensor, that can be installed in homes to conduct monitoring of temperature, humidity, and PM2.5 concentration. It is a compact mechanism, about the size of a hand. The data collected is synced to a cloud platform and open to the public. Through visualization of the data, the platform then provides information on local air pollution to the general public. The system fills in the gaps left by the low number [^fourth] of official Environmental Protection Administration air quality monitoring systems.

Thanks to AirBox, Taiwan has the highest density of air quality monitoring micro-stations in the world, with over 2000 monitoring locations across the country [^fifth]. As a matter of fact, development of air quality sensing systems had long been under way separately in the LASS (Location Aware Sensing System) community, as well as within Academia Sinica’s Institute of Information Science, and IT companies like Realtek. Taipei’s smart city initiative in 2016 became the catalyst for the community, academia, and companies to work together on air quality sensing. Their joint efforts eventually took AirBox from an experiment to a product and brought it from the community to the general public.

### Small Government Is the Starting Point for Public-Private Collaboration

Taking Amsterdam as a role model, Taipei City’s Department of Information Technology (DOIT) formulated a smart city policy that positioned City Hall as a matchmaker, providing incentives to encourage connections between companies and communities and building a smart city in a bottom-up way. Realtek was a company that actively reached out to become part of the initiative. The DOIT connected Realtek with the LASS maker community. The two parties began working together to improve the technology, and Academia Sinica provided assistance with data calibration. The result of their efforts was AirBox.

AirBox is more than just a PM2.5 sensor. It is part of the Maker Movement, encouraging users to modify it and use their creativity to come up with new uses. Users become part of its production chain. Taipei City went one step further, making AirBox part of environmental and IT education programs. Companies were commissioned to donate AirBoxes to elementary schools and junior high schools, allowing maker culture to take root in education. After the success of AirBox in Taipei City, eight counties and cities joined the project in 2016. Companies like Realtek, Edimax, Asus Cloud, and Aaeon helped AirBox expand across all of Taiwan.

The success of AirBox relied on several factors. In terms of technology, the sensor technologies it employs are not new, but the various facets of the system were made open source only recently, allowing the maker movement to adopt the technology. In terms of environmental awareness, the public is now increasingly familiar with the issues of air pollution and PM2.5, and AirBox provides citizens with a way to participate in environmental monitoring. In terms of politics, the paradigm set by Taipei City made other local governments more willing to participate.

This case displayed a successful private-public collaboration by building an ecosystem of civic tech. Each collaborative party benefited from this project. The government implemented its smart city policy by matching companies and communities and providing them with a place to show the results of their work—the city’s schools. Companies that donated AirBoxes were not only granted a public relations boon, they were also given an opportunity to expand beyond the Taiwan market with the city’s good will. Communities that provided technical assistance were rewarded with rapid growth as the AirBox project expanded throughout Taiwan. Academic institutions that assisted with calibration were given the opportunity to promote citizen science education and obtained more data for analysis. Government, companies, communities, and academia all shared resources and information, and each was rewarded for it. The AirBox case shows that governments should go beyond its traditional self-conception as a ruler over society and become a matchmaker for multi-stakeholders. Only when big government becomes small government can public-private collaboration begin to develop.

## 4-5. vTaiwan: Civic Tech Collaboration to Create an Open Space for Deliberation

> * Case: vTaiwan
> * Problem statement: How old and outdated laws and regulations can be adapted for the digital age
> * Government collaborator(s): Executive Yuan, Institute for Information Industry
> * Civil society collaborator(s): g0v participants

### Building an Online Deliberation Platform in a Hackathon

On December 20, 2014, then-Minister without Portfolio Jaclyn Tsai went to a g0v hackathon [^sixth] with one question: "Is it possible for companies not to headquarter in the Cayman Islands?" After a whole day of discussion in the hackathon, the participants concluded that, instead of having them answer the question of how to convince start-ups to stay in Taiwan, the question should be opened up to the general public by building a digital public participation platform. Minister Tsai and these civic hackers, bringing together Tsai’s legal background and their familiarity with the digital world, began to build the vTaiwan Virtual World Laws and Regulations Adaptation Exchange Platform. The platform particularly focuses on digital policies and allows discussion of how old and outdated laws and regulations can be amended for the digital age.

Standardizing and digitalizing the deliberation process is vTaiwan’s biggest contribution. To bring in more online participants, vTaiwan used technologies such as Discourse, Pol.is, and Sli.do to build online discussion spaces, and integrated them with physical offline meetings. As of the end of 2016, vTaiwan has been used to deliberate 18 issues. Amendments to laws and regulations have been enacted for half of the issues, while amendments for the remaining half are still in the drafting stage or awaiting legislative approval.

### Power and Relationships Should Be Opened Up

After the g0v community built vTaiwan, they did not hand over the operation of the platform to the government. Instead, the collaboration between the government and civic society has continued. Three parties are now in charge of operating the platform. (1) Issue sponsors: the government agencies which submit drafts of laws and regulations that they are proposing. (2) Editors: affiliated with the Institute for Information Industry, a government-sponsored NGO, which collect and organize the drafts into a format more conducive to discussion. (3) Administrators: g0v’s vTaiwan task force, which works together to maintain the online system and update the content. In addition, the administrators will invite active participants of each proposal to form working groups, which hold online and offline meetings to clarify points of disagreement, keep the issue focused, and suggest modifications. All working group meetings are recorded in text or video and made public online.

vTaiwan not only built an open platform for civic participation in digital-related law amendments, it also maintained an open approach during its system’s development and operation. There are no requirements or qualifications needed to participate in vTaiwan’s operation. Anyone interested can join their weekly meetings. The meetings are held outside of any government agency, with no chairperson or set agenda, to avoid the restrictive culture of the bureaucracy. This spirit of openness allows vTaiwan’s collaboration network to maintain equal and non-hierarchical relationships.

vTaiwan is an influential case since it is much more difficult to introduce civic tech to central government than to local governments. The social capital and political position held by vTaiwan proponents have been the key to its success. vTaiwan was first spearheaded by Jaclyn Tsai, with community participants helping to build the platform. Its later operations were mostly headed by Audrey Tang, who was then still a g0v participant. When Tang became Minister without Portfolio in October 2016, Tsai took over the running of vTaiwan as a member of civic society. These developments show that vTaiwan very much relied on the support of Ministers Tsai and Tang. 

### How Can vTaiwan Deepen Its Impact?

Although vTaiwan has become an institutionalized mechanism for adapting laws and regulations, there have been several cases (such as the issues of Uber and online liquor sales [^seventh]), in which draft legislations were eventually stalled in the legislature due to societal backlash. vTaiwan faces the following challenges in deepening its impact:

First, how can vTaiwan gain more active participants from the stakeholders of each issue? As vTaiwan aims at adapting laws and regulations for the virtual world, a rather difficult and obscure mission, it is hard to raise interests even among stakeholders. So far, the number and diversity of participants has been limited. vTaiwan needs to move beyond a mere online platform and be more active in connecting with communities to include more representative participants. Also, it is important to train more mediators to conduct communication and facilitation, in order to lower the platform’s barrier to entry and expand participation.

Second, how can vTaiwan avoid being caught up in divisive party politics, and give the voice of the people political influence through the deliberative process? In the online liquor sales controversy, vTaiwan had submitted an amendment bill to the legislature, which was identified as one of the session’s priority bills; however, the Executive Yuan withdrew the bill after the DPP took office in 2016, and no action has been taken on the issue since. This shows that party politics maintains primacy over deliberative democracy.

Third, how can this new mechanism for participation be integrated with existing mechanisms (such as public hearings); and how can legislators be brought into the process from the beginning, so that the deliberative democracy does not become cut off from representative democracy?

Fourth, are there enough staffers in various government agencies who are empowered and flexible enough to act as a contact between the government and civic society, ensuring clear communication and thus the political authority and influence of vTaiwan?

## 4-6. How to Facilitate Civic Tech Collaboration

### Civic Tech vs IT Procurement

Earlier in this chapter, a contrast was drawn between civic tech and IT procurement. Though both approaches attempt to provide governments with solutions through digital means, they are in fact appropriate for different types of problems. Civic tech is well suited to emergencies or situations in which problems and processes have not been clearly identified; collaborators can directly interact and communicate with the agency in need, using agile development to flexibly develop systems to solve the problem. IT procurement is well suited to systems with clear needs and long operational life cycles; government IT agencies can act as a mediator between the contractor and the agency in need, using the waterfall model to develop systems that are contracted out for operation and maintenance. However, we have also identified many difficulties with IT procurement in practice [^eighth] (Table 4.1).

Table 4.1 Problems faced with IT procurement

The biggest difficulty faced in IT procurement is identifying user needs. This difficulty means that many systems are incompatible with needs from the planning stage. In contrast to IT procurement, civic tech emphasizes interaction and communication in real practice. The collaborating parties work closely together to identify problems and ways to improve processes, instead of simply providing new tools. Civic tech is still unable to solve large-scale structural problems, but it has introduced new ways of thinking and culture, in the hopes of spurring governments to keep pace with the industry and listen to users’ needs. Civic tech can also provide more flexible solutions when existing IT procurement processes remain unimproved.

Civic tech is not necessarily mutually exclusive with IT procurement. For example, in the senior welfare center case with Taipei City, needs were first identified through a civic tech collaborative process, then the system was built through procurement and integrated into government operations. This case revealed the possibility for institutionalizing civic tech. However, as we have emphasized, civic tech does not only provide systems. Without reforming current IT procurement systems, purchasing civic tech may lead to reasonable compensation for collaborators, but it is not the best long-term way to institutionalize civic tech collaboration. How the influence of civic tech can be scaled up remains an unsolved problem.

### Four Models for Civic Tech

From the above cases, we identify four models for civic tech collaboration based on the interactive models and how closely the parties work together:

<div class="figure">

![Figure 4-1en](https://opengovreport.ocf.tw/assets/img/md/en/4-1en.png) 

Table 4.2 Four models for civic tech collaboration

</div>

In models A and B, the government plays only an auxiliary role and the focus is on the needs of citizens. The government provides open data or experimental spaces, and encourages the autonomous development of civic communities. In these two models, the government should not see itself as the sole provider of public services. On the contrary, models A and B require small government. With good policy as a foundation and solid infrastructure as a backbone, the government then encourages civil society and companies to provide public services and build a civic tech ecosystem.

Models C and D are more focused on government operations, and involve more in-depth interaction between the government and civil society. Civic tech under these two models may require integration with internal government systems and processes, so the collaborating parties must spend more time communicating and assessing possible political influences. These models require an open government, one of many stakeholders collaborating with civil society on an equal basis. 

For all of the above models, we have identified five key points for facilitating government connection and collaboration with civil society in the public sphere:

1. The political will and support of leaders are important.
2. Good mediators make the collaborative relationship smooth and efficient.
3. Collaborating parties must learn together to identify the right problems.
4. The collaboration process requires an opening up of power and relationships.
5. The approach to governance must be re-thought, from small government to open government.

### Turning Difficulties Into Challenges

Civic tech collaboration remains rare in Taiwan. Every case discussed in this chapter relied on good timing, favorable conditions, and dedicated people. It is difficult to copy any of them, and each has its limitations. In Taiwan, civic tech collaboration still faces difficulty in four major aspects:

* The institutional aspect: How can new and existing mechanisms or systems be integrated?
* The management aspect: How can civic tech developed through informal relationships be managed, maintained, and even held accountable?
* The talent aspect: How can the reliance on a few bridge builders be broken, so that civic tech collaboration can be beyond single unique cases?
* The societal aspect: How can a mature civic tech ecosystem be built to support collaborative relationships? 

As experimental civic tech collaborations begin to bear fruit, we must ask: Can they be scaled up and institutionalized in order to solve the aforementioned difficulties? 

While civic tech collaboration in Taiwan is still limited to ad-hoc single cases, systemic collaboration programs have been put into practice in other countries. Code for American and Code for Pakistan have started fellowship programs in their respective countries, using funds raised by civic groups to place engineers and designers into local governments for six months to a year. The engineers and designers then collaborate with government staffers to improve IT services. In Japan, governments work with companies to provide corporate fellowships, offering three-month grants for digital talent in companies to offer consultancy services at government agencies twice a week.

Similar programs have been discussed in Taiwan. After the Formosa Fun Coast explosion, Taipei City had consulted the community regarding the possibility of a fellowship program [^ninth]. However, the limitations of government personnel and procurement laws meant that such a program was never put into place. In addition, a funding model of civic tech has not been established. Where the investment comes from is a practical problem faced by civic tech advocates. Even today, government IT procurement treats IT services the same as hardware. This has hindered the development the software industry in public services. It will be difficult for civic tech to receive stable investment funding like in the US, when no civic tech industry has formed.

Government is an enormous and intricate machine. How can government take in different voices and approaches from the outside? How can it build a foundation of trust with another party, so that they can collaborate in an equal and mutually beneficial manner? How can laws and regulations open the door for interaction? What is the market and commercial value for civic tech? In the face of these big questions, civic tech cannot be content to remain an ideal or an experiment. We must face the political and economic questions behind civic tech, just as civic tech hopes to solve political and economic problems in society.
