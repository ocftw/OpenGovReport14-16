# 3. Citizen Participation

:::warning
## Key Findings 

### Citizen participation has taken root in Taiwan and the goal has been to lower the threshold to broaden participation

Citizen participation models built on deliberative democracy and open government have emerged. They mostly employ online tools and are designed to lower the threshold of participation through less rigorous forms of discussion. They are distinct from conventional forms of citizen participation (such as public hearings) and from deliberative democracy in the narrow sense which is small in scale and with strict forms.

### The political will of political leaders plays a critical role in citizen participation

Realization of citizen participation relies on the political will of politicians. The success of promoting participation lies in horizontal connections and the willingness of leaders to be integrated into this process, which then pushes the agencies and departments within the bureaucracy to get involved.

### The stage of policy making at which citizen participation is introduced directly affects its significance** 

The stage of policy making at which citizen participation is introduced has a decisive influence on the impact of participation. In addition, agenda setting, choice of issues, and the initiatives all play important roles. The method and process of participation also determine the quality of participation.

### Citizen participation is still largely experimental while some models are being institutionalized**

Most cases of citizen participation in this chapter were experimental. A few were implemented through administrative orders and some are being normalized or institutionalized, such as participatory budgeting at the local level.

 
### To improve the quality of participation, it is important to train civil servants in deliberative skills and invite intermediaries to help simplify the language and connect different parties.

Currently, empowering and training civil servants is the most urgent task. It is also important to invite intermediaries to help simplify the language used during discussion in order to lower the threshold of participation. These intermediaries can also help inform citizens, and at the same time, guarantee quality discussion.

## 3-1. Development of Citizen Participation in Taiwan

### Existing Participation Models

Citizen participation as a civil right is a crucial part of democracy. In Taiwan, citizen participation is safeguarded by article 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan). However, when Taiwan was under the Martial Law (1949-1987), participating in politics or expressing opinions on public issues were prohibited. When the Order of Martial Law was lifted, there was a wave of democratization movements and citizen participation finally started to pick up.

The 1999 Administrative Procedure Law stipulates that people should have the opportunity to participate in administrative dispositions, regulations, orders, and administrative plans and express their opinions. Other pieces of legislation that address citizen participation are the 1994 Environmental Impact Assessment Act and the Act for Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects. Both Acts require evaluation committees of relevant affairs to include citizens. Apart from the above two Acts, there are other institutionalized forms of citizen participation. Public hearings and explanatory meetings are good examples but since there is no law forcing the government to accept or consider people’s input, citizens’ voices may be easily disregarded.

### The Seeds of Open Citizen Participation

Since the beginning of the 21st century, democracies have met massive challenges around the world. Many so-called democratic governments merely keep the appearance of democracy with elections but have taken despotic actions that jeopardize human rights and democratic values (The Economist, 2014). People feel frustrated, disappointed, and unsatisfied by the performance of democracy (Lin, 2016) and initiated one street demonstration after another. The 2014 Sunflower Movement in Taiwan is an example of the people standing up to oppose a malfunctioning representative democracy.

In the face of weakening representative democracy, deliberative democracy became a highly anticipated possibility in Taiwan. It started during the second-generation National Health Insurance (2nd-gen NHI) reform process, in 2001. The reform was a three-year project. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) invited scholars to establish a citizen participation team in its planning committee. The scholars brought consensus conferences and the idea of deliberative democracy into the reform. In 2003, some Taiwanese scholars visited the Danish Board of Technology (DBT). They brought back various practices of deliberative democracy (Chen, 2012) and began to experiment on consensus conferences and scenario workshops after 2004.

```!
CONSENSUS CONFERENCE 
Volunteers are selected from different backgrounds and take relevant classes before the conference. In the conference, volunteers consult invited experts about the issue at hand. Then, the volunteers start a discussion which leads to a final report. This process usually takes 5 days.
```

In the 2014 Sunflower Movement, participants occupied the legislative chamber for 24 days, during which the idea of "D-Street" (citizen deliberation on the street) was created. D-Street was proposed to balance the representative power among different parties participating in the Movement. The occupation was divided into groups of protesters “inside” and “outside” the legislative chamber. While the protesters inside won more attentions from the public and the media, protesters outside the chamber felt disregarded and alienated. To expand participation, and give those outside a chance to express their views, and eventually, form a consensus, protesters began to practice D-Street (Shi, 2014). The 10-day D-Street experiment was carried out simultaneously in various locations at the demonstration site, with over 100 participants per day. Although the power relations inside and outside the legislative chamber did not truly “flip,” the practice drew public attention to deliberative democracy and the seeds of citizen participation were planted in civil society. 

After the Movement, the energy of Taiwan’s civil society became very strong, the strongest in decades. In that same year (2014), Ko Wen-je ran for Taipei City Mayor with the slogan of "open government, citizen participation" and won by a landslide. His promise was later realized in the forms of participatory budgeting projects and through “i-Voting” (an online voting system).

The above events made citizen participation not only known to the public but popular among local governments. Starting in 2014, there have been experiments with less rigid forms of citizen participation (such as the "World Café") to expand participation and lower costs. Also, with the advance of technology, online tools have become an important part of citizen participation. 

This chapter explores several new models of citizen participation that were influenced by deliberative democracy and open government. These models involved online tools, and were designed to lower the threshold of participation through less rigorous forms of discussion. Such models are distinct from institutionalized channels of citizen participation and from rigid practices of deliberative democracy, like the consensus conference. Through examining various cases, we want to ask whether these efforts have successfully empowered citizens and influenced policies, and whether they were true citizen participation.

### Structure of Analysis

This chapter includes the analysis of six cases of citizen participation between 2014 and 2016. It examines how citizen participation was practiced in each case, and how "open" each practice was. These cases were analyzed in an attempt to take a closer look at the participation experiences and to demonstrate different types of participation experiments between 2014 and 2016.

Our first case, the "Grassroots Forums of Civic Constitutional Convention" during the 2014 Sunflower Movement, is significant because of its bottom-up approach and its impacts on the following cases. We will then turn to two practices initiated by the government—the “Youth World Café” and the “Feiyan New Village” cases. The comparison of these two cases shows how agenda setting plays a key role in facilitating citizen participation. The next two cases are experiments on digital platforms. They are the electronic voting system in Taipei City, i-Voting, and the first online policy participation platform in Taiwan, JOIN.GOV.TW. Last but not least, participatory budgeting (PB) has become popular in many cities in Taiwan. Local governments have adopted various strategies and procedures to practice PB, so a handful of cases were chosen to represent different types of PB in Taiwan.

### The Blulu Metrics

We adopted the Blulu Metrics [^first] created by Lu Chia-hua and ET Blue to analyze the level and the quality of participation. The analysis looks into both the composition of participants and the impacts of citizen participation on the overall policy-making process. We made some adjustment to the Metrics to make it more suitable for our analysis. Also, to help readers quickly grasp the results of the analysis, the results will be communicated in both commentary and visualized scales. The purpose of Blulu Metrics is to help more people understand the structure of deliberation, the citizen participation process, and its challenges. The following paragraphs will explain how we used the Metrics.

We selected four tools from Blulu Metrics Family—Blulu Train A & B, Blulu Pizza, and Blulu Meter—to answer the following four questions in each case:

1. At which stage of the policy lifecycle was citizen participation involved?
2. What was the quality of deliberation?
3. Who were the participants?
4. What was the level of openness?

**I. Blulu Train A: At Which Stage of Policy Lifecycle Was Citizen Participation Involved?**

The Blulu Train A was used to determine the stage of the policy-making process at which citizen participation was involved. Generally speaking, the earlier it is involved, the less likely there will be a controversy at later stages.

//插圖
Figure 3.1 Blulu Train A (Policy Lifecycle)

**II. Blulu Train B: What Was the Quality of Deliberation?**

Blulu Train B divides the deliberation process into eight stages and each corresponds to one of the following eight questions:

1. Were opinions from civil society taken into account in agenda setting? Could citizens set the agenda?
2. Was there any research or survey conducted on the issue? Were the views of all stakeholders and civil society taken into consideration in the research?
3. Were the participants fully informed? Was relevant information open and transparent?
4. Was the form of discussion designed appropriately? Were the discussion led by experienced moderators?
5. Was there voting and in what form?
6. Did the process result in meaningful decisions? Did the conclusions of deliberation have an impact on decision making?
7. Did the government respond to the conclusions in meaningful ways? Did the government make any concrete promise or use the conclusions as the basis for decision-making and judgment?
8. Could the government be held accountable for the results of deliberation? Was there an appointed executive unit in the government? Was there any feedback mechanism that could be used for evaluation?

**III. Blulu Pizza: Who Were the Participants?**

Blule Pizza was used to evaluate the participants. Generally speaking, citizens are welcomed to participate and civil servants are often invited as well to show their political will. Quality citizen participation usually includes civil servants and stakeholders.

**IV. Blulu Meter: What Was the Level of Openness?**

Blulu Meter evaluates the level of openness in the policy-making process in the long run from three perspectives. The first is the healthiness of the procedure, the second is the openness of participation, and the third is policy continuity.

## 3-2. The Grassroots Forums of Civic Constitutional Convention

> Feature: bottom-up citizen participation
> Method: Occupy movement hand signals and group discussion
> Digital utilization: meeting manuals and minutes were published on a website 

### Bottom-up Constitutional Reform

Constitutional reform has been discussed for many years. Issues such as voting age and number of seats in the Legislative Yuan often spark discussion on constitutional reform. However, after article 12 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed by the last ad hoc National Assembly in 2005, it became significantly more difficult to make an amendment to the Constitution [^second]. In 2014, some civic groups established an alliance called the "Civil Movement for Constitutional Reform" to stimulate reform within government institutions, through grassroots meetings outside.

The alliance planned to achieve the goal of "Citizen Participation x Constitutional Reform" in three stages. First, hold “Grassroots Forums” around the island to invite people to deliberate relevant issues and propose possible approaches to political reform. Second, organize “Promotion Forums” to summarize the discussion at the first stage and put forward a concrete motion. At the third stage, the “Civic Constitutional Conventions” should be convened to deliberate the goals of reform and feasible solutions. The results are then sent to the Constitution Amendment Committee of the Legislative Yuan and a referendum would be held in 2018.

Starting from 2014, the Civil Movement for Constitutional Reform held many Grassroots Forums all over Taiwan. There were 25 forums held by July 2015. The alliance encouraged local civil society organizations (CSOs) to arrange forums on topics of interest and worked closely with them to raise the level of deliberation from specific topics to constitutional reform. Since many forums were organized by CSOs themselves, many participants were the stakeholders of the discussed topics and familiar with the relevant issues. In addition to the Grassroots Forums, the alliance also held training workshops for the moderators of deliberation.

The forum started with experts introducing the issues so that participants had a basic understanding. Then the discussion went in two rounds with Occupy movement hand signals. In round one, participants were invited to present their arguments and, in round two, they were asked to draw conclusions, sometimes in groups. The meeting minutes and videos are all open online [^third].

However, sometimes it was difficult to draw conclusions in round two. In addition, though the events were called Grassroots Forums, the issues and form of discussion were not really grassroots. Therefore, the challenge was how to translate complex and abstract concepts into something simpler so as to lower the threshold of participation. 

### Rapid Changes in the Society

In 2015, the drive for change in the society quickly died down. The Civil Movement for Constitutional Reform became a lobby group for constitution amendment. It also proposed a new procedure of constitutional reform, which incorporates the "bottom-up," deliberative approach [^fourth]. The original goal, “Citizen Participation x Constitutional Reform,” was not achieved, but a group of moderators supporting deliberation was cultivated thanks to the hard work of the Civil Movement for Constitutional Reform. This makes future experiments of citizen participation possible. While the Grassroots Forums were highly experimental, they have empowered civil society and encouraged the following experiments on citizen participation.

### Blulu Analysis

**I. Stage of Policy-making → Problem Analysis**

The Civil Movement for Constitutional Reform planned to use the Grassroots Forums as a platform to collect and organize issues regarding constitutional reform. According to Blulu Train A, the forums were held at the problem analysis stage of constitutional reform.

//插圖

**II. Quality of Deliberation**

The agendas of Grassroots Forums were set by CSOs with the help of the Civil Movement for Constitutional Reform. The CSOs’ views were taken into account during research and survey and participants were informed by experts’ introduction on the issues. However, since the forums were initiated by civil society and not institutionalized, the organizers could not move to government response and accountability.

//插圖

**III. Participants → No Civil Servants**

The Grassroots Forums were organized by CSOs and were open to citizens and, when on specific issues, private stakeholders, but no civil servants participated in the forums.

//插圖

**IV. Level of Openness → High, but It Was not a Legal Procedure**

The Civil Movement for Constitutional Reform was relatively open as it was initiated by CSOs and various stakeholders were invited. However, since it was not legalized, the results were not implemented and thus impossible to be evaluated.

### Broaden Participation in the National Conference on Trade and Economic Affairs

After the 2014 Sunflower Movement, the Executive Yuan convened the National Conference on Trade and Economic Affairs. However, the agenda setting of the conference failed to meet society’s expectations, and it was criticized for not being open enough to citizen participation. As a response to the criticism, the Executive Yuan organized a Youth World Café to diversify channels of participation. 

The World Café lasted a full day. Forty young people, who were selected by the organizer, discussed two main topics, "Taiwan’s Economic Development Strategy under Globalization" and “Strategy for Taiwan to Participate in Regional Economic & Trade Integration and for Cross-Strait Economic & Trade Affairs.” They were divided into 8 groups. Four groups focused on the first topic and the other four focused on the second. The moderator at each group guided the participants to discuss the chosen topic and then came to conclusions. During the process, participants “switched tables” four times to mix with other participants. At the end, the participants voted on the proposals and the top three of each topic were the conclusions of the World Café. Two participants were then elected as the representatives to speak at the National Conference (National Development Council, 2014).

### Is Divided Participation Real Participation?

The biggest problem with this World Café is the fact that these young participants were separated from those attending the National Conference. Since the purpose was to increase youth participation in the National Conference, why didn’t the organizer just invite more young people to the National Conference? In addition, the World Café could not meet the goal of facilitating dialogue between young citizens and the government since no government officials attended the discussion.

The participants’ representativeness was also called into question. The National Conference originated from the controversy over the cross-strait trade and economic affairs aroused by the Sunflower Movement, yet no protesters of the movement was invited to attend the World Café. The World Café was therefore criticized to be an act of patronization (Tseng, 2014). 

However, one of the proposals from the World Café was later turned into an online petition and citizen participation website, the Join platform, in 2015.

### Blulu Analysis

**I. Stage of Policy-making → Legislation**

The National Conference on Trade and Economic Affairs was convened because of the Sunflower Movement, which occurred during the legalization process of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA).

//插圖 

**II. Quality of Deliberation**

The agenda setting, research, and survey of the Word Café were all conducted by the Executive Yuan. There were project reports and presentations during the process, but they failed to achieve open participation and make participants fully informed. There were discussion and voting during the process and the Executive Yuan promised to make modifications accordingly and follow up on the progress of the modifications [^fifth].

//插圖

**III. Participants→ Not All Stakeholders Were Invited**

Both political appointees and civil servants attended the National Conference. However, since the entry was on invitation basis, the conference was not open to citizens, and the topics were too big to invite all stakeholders.

//插圖 

**VI. Level of Openness→ Low**

The National Conference can be thought of as a crisis management mechanism that only occurs when there is a major policy to be made. It is not a normal procedure for decision-making. The quality of participation is rather low due to the fact that participants are limited and that the stages of participation are far from comprehensive.

## 3-4. Feiyan New Village

> Feature: citizen participation on a specific issue with a relatively complete procedure
> Method: scenario workshop and Rural-Urban Forum
> Digital utilization: meeting minutes, relevant information and live streaming of meetings were all released on one website

### Feiyan New Village Urban Renewal Project

In 2010, Feiyan New Village, which covers 3.52 hectares in Tainan City, was selected to conduct urban renewal. In 2013, Farglory Land Development Co. won the bid to execute the project in Feiyan New Village and planned to build eleven skyscrapers. However, the development plan was protested by the locals because it would destroy large pieces of greenland and the Lioujiading Archeological Site, which was unearthed during the land survey.

Generally, before an urban renewal project is carried out, it has to go through reviews of several committees, which include the "Urban Renewal Committee," the “Transportation Impact Committee,” the “Urban Design Committee,” and the “Cultural Asset Committee.” Farglory sent its development plan to the committees right after it won the bid. However, the plan evoked strong protests from local citizens and the Tainan City Government was promoting open government at the time. Therefore, in 2015, the City Government decided to put the development plan to open decision-making through “Scenario Workshops” and the “Rural-Urban Forum.” 

**Scenario Workshop—Stakeholders and the City Government Clarified the Issue, Collected and Organized Information**

The scenario workshops were organized by a task force formed by different bureaus of Tainan City Government, experts and scholars, representatives from CSOs, Farglory and local residents. The purpose of the scenario workshops was to have stakeholders talk about the issue and develop future scenarios through dialogue and to propose corresponding action plans. Through this process, scenarios were turned into work principles that would eventually become guidelines of the City Government.

There were three scenario workshops on "protection for trees within the development area," “impact of development volume on the region,” and “reuse of archeological site and monuments” separately. Participants communicated, discussed, and made conclusions, which served as a reference for the Rural-Urban Forum at the next stage.

```!
SCENARIO WORKSHOP 
The organizer first prepares several "scenarios," each describes a possible situation. In the workshop, participants first share their views on the “scenarios” based on their experiences, which are then used as a basis for forming their preferred future scenario and eventually proposing a plan of action to make it come true. 
```

### Rural-Urban Forum—Citizen Group Discussion

The 108 participants of the Rural-Urban Forum were randomly selected from Tainan residents. In the forum, they were divided into 12 groups. Their discussion was led by the trained moderator at each table. The moderator was not allowed to express his or her views. There was also a note taker at each table to record the discussion in written form. After three rounds of discussion, the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire, which served as a reference for the City Government. At the end of the forum, there was also an open discussion for all participants to share their views freely.

However, the scenario workshops and the Rural-Urban Forum could not replace the original legal process. The development plan still had to pass the review of all committees to be finalized. Considering the opinions collected in the forum, over half of the committee members held the view that the cultural heritage in Feiyan New Village should be "kept in full." As a result, the project proposed by Farglory was suspended.                       	

### Which Issues Can Be Opened?

In the case of Feiyan New Village, the strong support and effort from Tseng Shu-cheng, then the Deputy Mayor, accelerated cross-bureau integration. His participation in social movements helped him gain the trust of the CSOs and made the dialogue among the City Government, the developer, and the CSOs possible.

It can be observed that the practice is a new model of citizen participation which still highly relies on the political will of the political leader. This deliberation had a complete procedure and actual political impact, and therefore, is a significant case of citizen participation in Taiwan.

However, this case also reveals the importance of agenda setting. Unlike the case of Feiyan New Village, another controversial development project in Tainan City, the underground railway construction project, was not opened for citizen participation. This shows that the City Government still places a tight grip on which issues can be "opened."

How to include citizen participation into existing institutions is another key issue. In this case, citizens’ views were brought into the legal framework through the committees. Therefore, the final decision was in fact still made by committees with more than half of its members coming from the government. 

### Blulu Analysis

**I. Stage of Policy-making →Planning**

In the Feiyan New Village urban renewal project, citizen participation was initiated before the development plan went into the legal process, so it was carried out during the policy planning phase. 

//插圖

**II. Quality of Deliberation**

The agendas of scenario workshops and the Rural-Urban Forum were confirmed by the workshop team and the participants conducted research and surveys on the issue at hand. The City Government also provided sufficient information and officials were on site to respond quickly and to appoint relevant units to take up responsibility, achieving accountability. In the Rural-Urban Forum, the discussion and research materials from the scenario workshops were presented in the forum manual to make participants informed and the discussion in the forum served as a reference for the City Government in decision-making.

//插圖

**III. Participants → Citizens and Government Representatives**

The participants of the scenario workshops included appointed officials, civil servants, and stakeholders while in the Rural-Urban Forum, in addition to the three types of participants mentioned, there were also the chosen citizens.

//插圖

**IV. Level of Openness→ Lack Policy Continuity as It Was Only on One Issue**

From the above analysis, it can be observed that the participation in the Feiyan New Village case had a rather good procedure and high level of openness. However, this case was specially chosen by the City Government to practice citizen participation and did not kick off an overall mechanism.

## 3-5. Taipei City’s i-Voting

> Feature: the first electronic voting system in Taiwan
> Method: local referendum in electronic and physical forms
> Digital utilization: electronic voting system, meetings were recorded on one platform
 
```!
I-VOVTING SYSTEM
The i-Voting is an electronic voting system for deciding public issues in Taipei. The proposals on the i-Voting platform can be either from administrative departments or from citizens. However, the procedure to propose a vote is comparatively difficult for citizens than for departments. As a result, until the end to 2016, there were only 10 proposals and all were put forward by administrative departments.
```

### Directions for Developing Shezidao

Open government and the i-Voting system were political promises made by Ko Wen-je during his campaign for Taipei City Mayor. After he took office, he immediately had the i-Voting website built. Among the proposals on i-Voting, we chose the most controversial and influential Shezidao case to have a closer look at the system.

Shezidao is situated in Shilin District, Taipei City. In 1970, Shezidao was classified as a flood area, and therefore, a "restricted development area". Construction was either prohibited or limited and so was the development of Shezidao. The buildings and infrastructure later became obsolete and development lagged behind. Past Taipei City Mayors tried to solve the issue, but no attempt was successful due to environmental protection reasons. After Ko took office, he proposed to let citizens make the decision through the i-Voting platform in order to fix this longstanding problem.

Three solutions were proposed by Taipei City Government: "Canal Shezidao," “Eco-Shezidao,” and “Our Shezidao.” There were two votes: one was for Shezidao residents to choose their favorite solution; the other was open to all Taipei City residents. In addition to online voting, there were also ballot boxes set up in Shezidao. 

### Does Voting Represent Democracy

This case was highly controversial because all three solutions were proposed by the City Government and local citizens were not invited to express opinions on possible solutions. Moreover, there was no clear plan addressing citizens’ main concerns, the compensation for relocation and the support for resettling. Therefore, people were worried they would become homeless when the development begins. After Shezidao citizens protested and even threatened not to vote, the City Government added a "No Development" option, which only created even bigger conflict. Many residents felt cheated and, in the end, the voting rate was only 35%. “Eco- Shezidao” won the vote and the development project was sent to the Urban Design Review Committee.

The Shezidao case revealed the flaws of the i-Voting system. This online voting system does not support deliberation or discussion. Citizen participation is not included in the stages of proposing solutions and final policy-making. It merely happens in voting. An urban planning project like the Shezidao case has to go through a number of different committees and procedures. All these procedures will affect how the project is revised, so it is significant to have citizens participate in all stages [^sixth].

### Blulu Analysis

**I. Stage of Policy-making →Planning**

Citizens participated at the planning stage before the urban planning project went into legal procedures.

//插圖

**II. Quality of Deliberation**

The agenda setting, research and survey of the solutions on the i-Voting in the Shezidao case were conducted by the City Government. Although participants were informed, there was no discussion in the process. Also, the project that won the vote was not the final decision because of the possible revisions by various committees.

//插圖

**III. Participants → Lacked Dialogue**

Even though local residents and Taipei citizens both can vote, there was no dialogue between citizens and the government.

//插圖

**IV. Level of Openness→ Not a Healthy Process but It Has Policy Continuity**

The i-Voting system is not a very healthy process of citizen participation. Its design lacks room for public discussion and its agenda setting is not truly open, which can be seen in the Shezidao case. However, as the system is backed by an administrative order, it is expected that it will have policy continuity.

## 3-6. The Join Platform

> Feature: the first public policy discussion platform in Taiwan
> Method: provide policy suggestion on an online platform
> Digital utilization: online platform

### The Join Platform

As one of the conclusions of the National Conference on Trade and Economic Affairs, the Join Platform was set up by the[ National Development Council](http://www.ndc.gov.tw/) (NDC) in 2015 to encourage online citizen participation. It took reference from the White House website, We the People [^seventh]. The platform serves as a channel of revealing policy information and enhancing citizen participation in public affairs on a regular basis.

There are four functions on the Join platform: "Propose an Idea" (by citizens), “Have a Discussion” (consultation before a policy is formed), “Let’s Oversee” (key policies), and “Talk to the Ministers” (links to mailboxes of Ministers for citizens to express their views). Through the Join platform, citizens can make policy proposals online and the responsible agency is bound to respond openly and in detail on the platform within two months.

```!
THE JOIN PLATFORM
All proposals on the Join Platform have to go through two stages of petition. There has to be 250 signatures in 15 days at the first stage and 5000 signatures in 30 days at the second stage for a proposal to become a case. After that, the responsible agency has to give a response in two month. The agency can hold consultation meetings and invite the proposer to attend. All of the meeting materials has to be open on the platform.
```

### Fast and Convenient but Difficult to Have a Discussion

The Join platform is a convenient and easy-to-use platform with a very low threshold of participation. A citizen can easily make a proposal after passing mobile phone or email validation. As a result, the platform is wildly used. Proposals on the platforms have real political impact, especially on the cases that draw public attention. Till now, 71 proposals have become official cases. Since the platform is backed by an administrative order, people can hold relevant agencies accountable and are guaranteed a concrete response.

However, the current design makes it difficult to have a meaningful "discussion." A seconder can enter his or her opinion, but the opinion is merely for reference and there is no discussion area on the proposal page. Also, even though the responsible agency has to respond within the timeline, there is no mechanism for follow-up oversight or discussion on the platform. Whether a proposal comes to a conclusion or not, the case seems to be closed and participation stops after a response is given.

### Blulu Analysis

**I. Stage of Policy-making → Problem Analysis**

The Join platform enables citizens to have a voice on policy directions, so they participated at the problem analysis stage.

//插圖

**II. Quality of Deliberation**

The agenda setting, research, and survey of proposals on the Join platform are all conducted by the person proposing the policy. Since they only need to provide the reason for proposing the item, it cannot be certain whether they are well informed. The petition process is practically an open, lax, single-option vote. As the responsible agency is only required to give a response, it is difficult to achieve accountability.

//插圖

**III. Participants → Hard to Tell**

The Join platform is open to all citizens. It does not put any special weight on stakeholders.

//插圖

**IV. Level of Openness→ Not All Stages Are Open for Participation, Good Prospect of Policy Continuity**

The Join platform is simply a petition platform. While it can stimulate public attention on the issue at hand, whether later stages of policy-making are open depends on the responsible agency. Still, since the platform is supported by an administrative order, its prospect of policy continuity is comparatively good.

## 3-7. Participatory Budgeting

```!
PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING 
Participatory Budgeting (PB) started in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1988. The elected Workers' Party Mayor wanted to reprioritize City Government Budgets so he invited local communities to decide the priority of part of the public spending. Generally speaking, PB is a process in which representatives of the local communities and residents discuss and make proposals, which are later put to vote. PB has spread across the world. More than 1,500 cities and communities have practiced or are practicing PB.
```

Compared to other forms of citizen participation, PB is a relatively complex and highly experimental process. PB has become an international trend. In Taiwan, PB was one of Ko Wen-je’s key political promises in the 2014 election for the Taipei City Mayor. Since then, many city mayors and county magistrates have seen PB as an important political promise. Currently, PB is mostly practiced at the local government level.

### Taipei City: Administration Driven

> Feature: administration driven
> Method: five stages, which are promotion, proposal & review, budget evaluation, budget review, city council oversight
> Digital utilization: using an internet platform to organize proposals and information on workshops [^eighth]

**PB Driven by Administrative Units**

Taipei City is the pioneer of PB in Taiwan. After Mayor Ko made the promise in 2014, Taipei started to hold training workshops and set up a series of procedures before implementing PB in 2016. PB was implemented by administrative units in the Taipei City Government. There were five stages in the process—promotion, proposal & review, budget evaluation, budget review, and city council oversight.

The Department of Civil Affairs under the City Government is responsible for PB projects. The Department partnered up with nine universities and three community colleges, each taking on an administrative district to facilitate PB collaboration. If the winning proposal can be included in the year’s annual budget, it is reported to the Citizen Participation Committee, implemented by the department concerned, and overseen as well as evaluated by the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission to achieve accountability. Otherwise, the proposal will be included in next year’s budget and reported to the City Council by the Mayor.

**High Administrative Costs**

The first round of PB projects in Taipei took massive administrative costs and government manpower. The roles the Citizen Participation Committee and the university partners played were rather burdensome. In theses first attempts, because the partners practiced PB in different ways, the forms of proposal and review in each district were different as well. 

Many winning proposals were later rejected by the responsible departments due to compliance or feasibility issues. This had led to doubts on the "openness" of Taipei’s PB. The root cause of the problem was that the departments did not participate in the early stage of proposal making. Also, since PB was driven by the City Government, the Taipei City Council felt much pressure from budgeting and oversight. Some city councillors argued that they should have the power to “reject, cancel, or cut” budgets of PB proposals that passed citizen deliberation and even said that PB “made representative democracy immoral.” [^ninth]

### New Taipei City: Councillor Discretionary Fund and Themed PB

**Councillor Discretionary Fund Allocation**

> Feature: councillor discretionary fund allocation
> Method: a village chief was tasked by the councillor to conduct PB
> Digital utilization: one unified platform recording all PB projects in New Taipei City

The first attempt of PB in New Taipei City was initiated by councillor Chen Yi-chun. She took the example of the "Chicago Model" from the US and utilized her discretionary fund to conduct PB in Daguan Village with the assistance of the village chief. Through proposal making, committee review, and voting, there were three winning proposals at the end.

```!
THE CHICAGO MODEL 
The first PB practice in the US was in Chicago City. An alderman of Chicago City has about USD 1.32 million of discretionary fund per year which can only be used on infrastructure. The allocation of the fund is completely at the alderman’s discretion. In 2007, Alderman Joe Moore practiced PB in his ward to allocate his discretionary fund for the first time. Now, there are also PB projects in New York City initiated by aldermen working with local communities and NPOs. There are currently 24 aldermen supporting PB in New York City.

The Daguan Village case was small scale and was pushed forward by a councillor, so the coordination with administrative departments went rather smoothly. However, there was no oversight in the process and one of the three proposals has not been implemented. Also, since it was the village chief that mobilized residents to participate, some suspected that the chief was using PB to solidify his own position.

### Themed PB Conducted by Commissioned Community College

> Feature: PB on a designated fund
> Method: the government commissioned a community college to conduct PB
> Digital utilization: one unified platform recording all PB projects in New Taipei City

Apart from the case of the city councillor initiating PB in 2015, the Economic Development Department of New Taipei City Government also commissioned Ludi Community College to implement PB on an energy conservation fund in Ludi.

The process was rather comprehensive. It included seminars, a proposal workshop, a deliberation workshop, a finalization workshop and a voting fair. There were six seminars targeting six groups of people who potentially had a stake in energy conservation. Knowing the possibility that existing organizations might mobilize supporters to take over PB, the College had multiple small-scale promotions on the street to invite more people to attend the seminars. There were different energy conservation lessons in each seminar and proposal sheets were handed out to collect ideas. After the seminars, counsellors contacted the attendees and encouraged them to continue participation.

The counsellors then invited those who handed in the sheet to participate in the proposal workshop to develop more detailed plans, empowering and supporting the citizens or teams to make a proposal. The proposal plans were presented by its proposer to citizens in the deliberation workshop, in which the plans were deliberated in small groups and then revised.

Officials from relevant departments then provided budgeting and feasibility suggestions to the revised plans in the finalization workshop. Negotiation and text revision between the two parties were done on site. The final proposals were voted in the voting fair and there was the option to vote down on the ballots.

**Focus on Empowerment and Learning**

Compared to other PB cases, the process of the energy conservation PB focused on the "empowerment" of the local community. It was designed to lower the threshold of participation as much as possible. Ludi Community College also put efforts into reaching people who were not frequently mobilized by local political powers. Moreover, the process was designed to increase local proposers’ confidence and competence.

The intermediary or the organizer played a very important role. PB not only empowered the citizens but stimulated the development of the local community. However, the task of the College was finished after the proposals were selected and sent to the government. It was a shame that citizens participation stopped after the government department took over.

### Taichung City: Outsourcing PB

> Feature: outsource PB through bidding
> Method: the Taichung City Government commissioned a CSO to implement PB
> Digital utilization: Taichung digital platform and an online proposal map

PB began in Taichung City after its announcement by Mayor Lin Chia-lung in 2015. The Taichung City Government outsourced PB to a local CSO. A project office ran by the CSO was then set up and the Department of Civic Affairs was its staff unit. Therefore, the relationship between the executor of PB and the City Government was vendor to client.

Taichung’s PB included four stages, "Brainstorming," “Deliberation & Project Development,” “i-Voting,” and “Implementation & Monitoring.” PB was first promoted in public spaces in district offices, then in public info sessions as well as living room info sessions. There were five main target groups: individual citizens, community building organizations, schools and community colleges, social welfare groups, and village chiefs & neighbourhood wardens. These five groups were invited to come in groups while interested individuals were given a living room info session. A neighbourhood assembly was held next, in which participants discussed proposals through deliberation and form action plans with the ladder method. In the assembly, there was an innovative session called Lottery Marketplace for each team to further discuss the action plans. After the plans were formed, the City Government invited relevant departments and experts to each district to meet with proposers and provide suggestions on laws and regulations, feasibility, and reasonable budgeting.

**PB by a Vendor**

Taichung citizens voted in the PB project with physical ballots. On the voting day, citizens participated in deliberation in small groups on the street and gave their votes, similar to the D-Street in the Sunflower Movement. However, since the PB was carried out by a "vendor," the vendor could not fully cover the following oversight & evaluation and the communication between departments and proposing citizens.

In Taiwan, the implementation of PB highly relies on the political will of mayors or magistrates. This is especially true when there is a need for cross-department coordination. In this case, it was a big challenge for the CSO "vendor" to coordinate between departments without the political support from a high-ranking official.

Also, Taichung’s PB was outsourced and the operation office was not a regular unit. The corresponding civil servants were not well trained and a PB mechanism inside the bureaucracy was not created.

In addition, the Taichung City Government did not allocate a dedicated budget for implementing PB proposals, and the budgets came from the departments. Worried that PB would limit the funds for other projects, the departments were conservative and hesitant to implement PB. This stretched the vendor’s operational fund as well.

PB in Taichung heavily relied on local powers, such as village chiefs and councillors, for promotion. Some of these leaders stepped outside their original roles and helped with explanation, oversight, and coordination, some mobilized supporters to pass proposals that met their interests, and still others were opposed to PB. 

## 3-8. Difficulties and Challenges

From the above cases, it is obvious that citizen participation in Taiwan has been practiced mostly in experimental, individual cases. A few of them were implemented with administrative orders, such as the Join platform and i-Voting. Some citizen participation models are being normalized or institutionalized, such as PB in Taipei City and in Taichung City. However, is institutionalization the answer to current challenges of citizen participation? 

Successful citizen participation usually lies in the political will of the political leader in Taiwan. Also, agenda setting, choice of issues, citizen’s right of initiative play critical roles. That is to say, the political leader cannot only open the issues he or she considers "suitable to be handled through open citizen participation," but should also give citizens the power to decide “which issues should be opened for participation.”

The mechanism and process of citizen participation is a significant factor of quality participation. The government should really put more focus on empowering civil servants, including stakeholders in the discussion, deciding who the stakeholders are, the interaction among agencies, ministers, and stakeholders, and most importantly, decision-making methods as well as true accountability. To achieve all these, political leaders must first understand the value of citizen participation to the administrative system.

Also, to expand participation, complex concepts need to be simplified, but this may lower the quality of discussion. Therefore, practitioners have to strike a balance between lowering the threshold of participation and processing complex but important issues. Intermediaries play an important role in simplifying complicated topics. In some of the cases, it was done by a CSO or by a community college. However, mutual understanding and close cooperation between these intermediaries and the government is still a challenge for both sides. 

In the cases discussed so far, digital utilization did not play a big role. In most PB projects, websites were simply used as platforms to collect and organize information and live streaming was used to expand participation. However, we also saw many attempts of active digital utilization. For example, the Taipei City Government attempts to include electronic voting in its PB and the Taichung City Government is trying to visualize PB with a proposal map.
